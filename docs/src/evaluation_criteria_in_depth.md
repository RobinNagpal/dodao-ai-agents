# Evaluation Criteria

When evaluating a company (ticker) on the KoalaGains platform, itâ€™s important to use **criteria that are specific to the company's industry group**. This ensures that all generated reports and chartsâ€”such as the **spider chart**, **performance checklist**, **metrics**, **text reports**, and **visual charts**â€”are relevant, accurate, and helpful for investors making decisions.

To make the evaluation meaningful, KoalaGains uses a structured **evaluation criterion** that guides what data is collected and how it is interpreted. If the evaluation criteria are poorly defined, the resulting reports may be misleading or incomplete. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s essential to define each criterion **clearly and carefully**.

## What Does an Evaluation Criterion Include?

Each evaluation criterion has the following attributes:

- **Name** â€“ The title of the criterion (e.g., Debt and Leverage).
- **Key** â€“ A lowercase version of the name, with spaces replaced by underscores (e.g., `debt_and_leverage`).
- **Matching Instruction** â€“ A short description that tells the AI agent how to find and match the relevant information from SEC filings.
- **Important Metrics** â€“ A list of key numerical indicators used to measure the companyâ€™s performance for this specific criterion.
- **Reports** â€“ A definition of the types of reports that should be generated (e.g., spider chart, checklist, visual reports).
- **webhookUrl** â€“ The URL of the AI agent responsible for processing this criterion and generating the reports.

You can edit or create evaluation criteria for a specific **industry group**â€”for example, REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)â€”by visiting the following link:

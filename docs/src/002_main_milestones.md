# Major Milestones

### **V0 - Proof of Concept: Crowdfunding**  (80% done)
The initial phase focuses on understanding agents, their effectiveness, and extracting useful insights. Crowdfunding 
was chosen as the target domain due to limited available information, which can be valuable for investors. Key features 
include spider charts with ratings for evaluation, a summary analysis mirroring the chart, and detailed assessments for 
each category. While initial results show the agent's accuracy is around 50-60%, improvements are underway by refining 
the data processing pipeline and ensuring consistency in AI-generated insights.

### **V1 - Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)**  (30% Done)
The next phase shifts to REITs, given their structured and less variable data, making them a suitable target for deeper 
analysis. This includes a comprehensive examination of REITs, comparisons across different property sectors, and 
evaluations of growth trajectories to identify potential undervalued investment opportunities. Additionally, REIT-related 
SEC events and filings will be analyzed to provide a clearer picture of market movements.

### **V1 - SEC Filings Summarization & Timeline**  
A dedicated product for summarizing SEC EDGAR filings is being developed, with two main components: structured summaries 
of filings and a timeline for key events. The goal is to extract and categorize critical information, balancing 
quantitative and qualitative insights while maintaining context. Important filings such as 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K will be 
processed to enhance the understanding of REITs' financial health and strategic plans. The challenge of summarizing 
lengthy documents while preserving essential details is a primary focus.

### **V2 - Customizable AI Agents**  
The next iteration will enable users to create their own AI agents tailored to specific investment strategies and 
sectors. This will provide greater flexibility for investors to generate insights aligned with their preferences. By 
allowing users to configure agent behavior, the system aims to improve the accuracy and applicability of AI-driven 
analysis across various domains.

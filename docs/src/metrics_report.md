# Metrics

**Metrics** are an essential report type offered by KoalaGains. They provide key **numerical insights** that help investors evaluate a company's position more clearly and accurately. Each metric is directly related to a specific **evaluation criterion** and gives measurable data points that support investor decision-making.

## Key Features of Metrics

- Metrics are **criterion-specific**, meaning they are tailored to the particular area being evaluated—such as Debt and Leverage, Liquidity, or Stock Types.
- These values are **quantitative**, offering factual data instead of opinions or estimates.
- Metrics allow investors to quickly understand a company’s performance using important financial figures.
- Because the same set of metrics is used for all companies within the **same industry group**, investors can easily **compare** performance across multiple companies.

## Structure of a Metric

Each metric has the following components:

### **Inputs:**

- **Name** – The title or label of the metric.
- **Formula** – The method used to calculate the value.
- **Description** – A brief explanation of what the metric measures and why it matters.

### **Outputs:**

- **Name** – The metric being presented.
- **Value** – The calculated result based on company data.
- **Explanation** – A short interpretation of what the value means in the context of the company’s performance.

These components work together to provide both **raw numbers and understandable context**, making it easier for users to interpret the data.

## Why Metrics Matter

- Metrics give **direct visibility** into a company’s financial condition and operational efficiency.
- Investors can use them to spot **strengths, weaknesses, or red flags** based on objective data.
- With consistent metrics across companies in the same industry group, **comparative analysis** becomes more reliable and insightful.

# Vision
We are building a platform that will provide raw data, quantitative and qualitative information on each of the
factor that can affect the performance and valuation of a company. The platform will also keep track of 
current events, and trends in the industry. Along with this the platform will keep track of sentiment analysis
of various topics, keywords, products, sectors, and companies.

This information will be created using low level AI tools which will be targeted towards extracting specific information.
The extracted information will be highly accurate, and will be completely fact and data based. This will include
both quantitative and qualitative information.

On top of this information, we will build AI agents that will consolidate all this information and provide a reports
based on the investment style, and investment horizon of the business, analyst, or investor.

For each of the different styles, and different sectors, different agents need to be build to generate accurate reports.
This definitely looks like a huge effort, but many of these type of reports are not available in the market right now,
and creating such reports reports using conventional methods will have exorbitant costs.

It is very important that all financial decisions are based on data, and not on gut feeling. This platform will
help make it easier for the investors to make decisions based on data.


# Problem Statement
There are a few problem statements we are working towards. We right now don't know what will be our first target
use case or market. May be we will get clarity after we create

## Use Case 1 - Onchain
TBills became a huge hit as an onchain product. Other than T-bills, there are not many quality products available
onchain. To bring good products on chain
1. We need data to prove those are good products
2. We need some comparative analysis.

Target Market for these will be private investors, and institutional investors.

## Use Case 2 - Investor Reports
Right now there are hundreds of thousands of analysts that are writing reports on companies. A lot of these reports
can be automated by AI. We will be producing quality reports for a sector and then will ask for work to 
create agents for these type of reports.


## Use Case 3 - Growth ETFs
Venture Capital is a very lucrative business, and one of the strategy they follow is to place high number of bets.
They know that most of the bets will fail, but the ones that succeed will give them huge returns.

Simple ETF products can be made based on this strategy. There products will not be famous
in current public markets, but they can add a lot of value in the onchain world.

DeFi offer primitives for DEX, and Lending/Borrowing, and those can add a lot of value.

Target Market for these will be private investors, and institutional investors.


## Use Case 4 - General Investing in Pubic Equities

Because of the high inflation globally, investing is more important than ever.

I want to invest money, but I am not able to get access to good amount of information which is both quantitative and
qualitative.

There are websites like
- Yahoo Finance
- Google Finance
- Stockanalysis

https://simplywall.st is a great resource which provides both quantitative and qualitative information.

What does Simply wall street lack
- Industry wide comparison
- Showing a timeline of all the events
- In depth information of the company
- Growth/Improvement trajectory, specially in comparison to other players in that sector
- Sector specific evaluation
    - For example when evaluation REITs, we will consider rent, and debt
    - For evaluating oil companies we will consider ...



## Use Case 5 - Strategy based investing in public equities
Every investor has a different goals and different risk tolerance. Based on those goals and risk tolerance, they
would want to access different types of information.

For example a growth investor would want to invest in companies that are growing at a fast pace, and are not
profitable yet. 

A value investor would want to invest in companies that are undervalued. 

A dividend investor would want to invest in companies that are paying good dividends.

So based on the strategy, the information required will be different. Thee are many people that can recommend
strategies, but there is no platform that can provide information based on those strategies.

They can use our platform to get information and show it to their customers/clients.

Target Market for these will be public investors, and institutional investors.

# Next Steps
- V0 - First we need to prove the effectiveness of the agent which will be done by 
  1) First understanding how agents work
  2) Creating an agent for CrowdFunding
  3) Making the agent quite accurate
- V1 - Then we can target another sector which deal with REITs
- V2 - Then with private credit/public credit firms.

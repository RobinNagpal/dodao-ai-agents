# Problem Statement
There are a few problem statements we are working towards. We right now don't know what will be our first target
use case or market. May be we will get clarity after we create

## Use Case 1 - General Investing in Pubic Equities

Because of the high inflation globally, investing is more important than ever.

I want to invest money, but I am not able to get access to good amount of information which is both quantitative and
qualitative.

There are websites like
- Yahoo Finance
- Google Finance
- Stockanalysis

https://simplywall.st is a great resource which provides both quantitative and qualitative information.

- Showing a timeline of all the events

These don't need to be securities and can be served as Reg-D offerings as there are many accredited investors who
will be

# V1 - REITs

We though there is less variation in the REITs and the information available is more structured. So we thought it would
be a good sector to target next.

### In-dept Analysis of the REIT (In Progress)
We find the detailed information about the REITs and provide a summary of the information.

### Timeline of SEC Events for a REIT
See "V1 - Summarized SEC EDGAR Filings" below

### Sector Specific Evaluation and comparison
For example compare REITs that target multi-family homes, commercial properties, or industrial properties, warehouses,
data centers, etc.

### Growth Trajectory
May be the current state is not so good, but the growth trajectory is good. This can be a good investment opportunity
because the REIT can be undervalued at the current time.

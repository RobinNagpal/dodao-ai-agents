# Criteria

![Criteria](./images/criteira_and_report/custom-criteria.png)

For example, for the REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) industry group, evaluation criteria include:

- Debt and Leverage: REITs rely heavily on debt financing, so assessing leverage helps determine their financial stability and risk exposure.
- FFO (Funds from Operations) & AFFO (Adjusted Funds from Operations): These metrics adjust for depreciation and capital expenditures, providing a clearer picture of a REITâ€™s true earnings and cash flow.
- Rental Income: Since REITs generate revenue primarily from leased properties, rental income is a key indicator of profitability and asset performance.
- Stock type: They are important for REIT evaluation because the issuance of preferred stock can reduce cash flow available to common shareholders (CSH) due to fixed dividend obligations

Each of these criteria has three major things

- Performance checklist indicators: These are used to assess a particular criterion. For example, for assessing debt and leverage, we further have net debt to EBITDAre ratio, interest coverage ratio, debt maturity profile, weighted average interest rate and liquidity reserves.
- Metrics: These are quantitative measures used to compare different companies within the same industry group.
- Detailed reports: The reports provide detailed information on the data used to assess and rate each criterion.

# Chart Reports

In addition to text-based reports, **KoalaGains also offers Chart Reports** to visually represent important financial and operational data. These charts are especially useful when comparing multiple data points or categories within a specific criterion.

Chart Reports come in various formats, including:

- **Pie Charts**
- **Spider Charts**
- **Waterfall Charts**
- **Sankey Diagrams**

Each chart type is designed to highlight specific relationships or proportions within the data, helping investors make faster and more informed decisions.

## Why Chart Reports Matter

- **Clear Visual Comparisons**  
  Chart Reports provide a complete visual summary of the topic being analyzed. For example, a pie chart can show the breakdown of different debt types, giving investors a quick view of how each part contributes to the whole.

- **Better Decision-Making**  
  Visual data is often easier to interpret than raw numbers alone. These reports help investors quickly identify trends, imbalances, or strengths across categories.

- **Works Alongside Text Reports**  
  Chart Reports can stand alone or be paired with **Text Reports**. Sometimes a chart will be supported by a detailed explanation, and other times the chart is used to visually enhance the written insights.

- **Detailed Table Support**  
  Many charts are also accompanied by a **detailed table**, giving a complete numerical breakdown to support the visuals. This ensures transparency and helps users explore the data in more depth.

By combining visuals with data and explanation, Chart Reports help KoalaGains users better understand complex information at a glanceâ€”without losing accuracy or depth.

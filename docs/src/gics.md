# GICS

The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) is an industry taxonomy that consists of 11 sectors, 25 industry groups, 74 industries and 163 sub-industries into which S&P has categorized all major public companies.

When evaluating companies based on different parameters, it is crucial to develop criteria specific to their industry. However, creating custom evaluations for all 163 sub-industries is an enormous task, requiring extensive research. Even evaluating companies at the industry level (74 industries) remains too complex and resource-intensive. A more realistic and balanced approach is to focus on industry groups (25 in total), as they offer a classification that is neither too broad nor too specific. This ensures that evaluations remain detailed enough to capture industry-specific factors while avoiding excessive division, making the process more manageable and effective.

## Why GICS?

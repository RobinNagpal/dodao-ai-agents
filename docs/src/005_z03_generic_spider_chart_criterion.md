# Sectors and Sub-sectors for Public Equities
Here we have captured all the sectors and sub-sectors for public equities https://github.com/RobinNagpal/dodao-ui/tree/main/insights-ui/src/app/investment-sectors.

We spent a lot of time working on REITs, and I am not sure if we got too much tangible output if we compare it with
what pure AI results would have produced. It will be interesting to see how the two compare i.e. comparing the
reports generated by AI with the reports generated by us manually writing the prompts for each criterion



# Populating Criterion for Spider Charts

Process for creating the spider charts for all the tickers based on AI

1. `Verify sub-sectors and sub-sub-sectors` - Share your ideas on how will you make sure that
   the list is holistic and complete for all the tickers.

2. `Extract 8 Criterion for each sub-sector` - We can call chatgpt to extract 8 criterion for each sub-sector.
   Things we can ask for in the repose for each criterion are:
    - Importance/Rank of Importance of the criterion
    -  What type of information belongs to the criterion
    - What are the data points that can be used to measure the criterion
    - What normalized data points can be used to measure the criterion (value/Revenue etc.) so that we can compare
      various companies in the same sector
    - What are the ideal values for the criterion
    - List of public companies that are operating in the same sub-sub-sector
    - Five most important points to consider while analyzing the criterion(This will be used for scoring the criterion for spider chart)
    - What type of charts can be used to represent the information for the criterion. Explain the chart type and why it is useful

3. Find best way of soring this information. Also allowing to re-trigger the AI to get the updated information

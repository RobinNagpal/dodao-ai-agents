## Why KoalaGains is Needed

Many existing platforms like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and StockAnalysis focus mainly on providing **quantitative data**—such as financial ratios, stock prices, and earnings reports. While this information is useful, it doesn’t always give investors a full picture of a company's health or performance.

On the other hand, platforms like Motley Fool and Seeking Alpha offer **opinions and commentary**, but they often lack detailed, **industry-specific analysis** that combines both numbers and deeper insights.

This is where **KoalaGains** stands out.

KoalaGains bridges the gap by providing **both qualitative and quantitative insights**, tailored to specific industries. It gives investors a clearer, more complete understanding of a company's financial health, competitive position, and overall business performance.

### What Makes KoalaGains Different?

- **Industry-Specific Evaluations:** Users can define the evaluation criteria based on the industry group a company belongs to, allowing for more meaningful analysis.
- **Smart Data Extraction:** Based on the selected criteria, KoalaGains pulls relevant information directly from the company’s latest SEC filings.

- **Custom Report Creation:** Users can generate multiple reports under each set of criteria, depending on what insights they’re looking for.

- **Visual and Text Reports:** Reports can be written summaries or visual formats like pie charts, spider charts, waterfall charts, and Sankey diagrams, making it easier to understand complex data.

### Additional Features of KoalaGains:

- **Performance Checklist:** A quick overview to assess key areas of company strength or weakness.
- **Important Metrics:** A focused view on the financial numbers that matter most.
- **Spider Chart:** A multi-dimensional view to compare performance across several factors at once.

In short, KoalaGains provides a smarter, more customizable way to evaluate public companies—helping investors make more informed decisions.

## Support for Custom Reports

KoalaGains not only provides in-depth qualitative and quantitative analysis of a company’s financial health and business performance, but it also gives users the power to create their own custom evaluation criteria.

Originally, the criteria used to evaluate companies in different industry groups were defined only by the KoalaGains team. However, the platform has now evolved to become more flexible and user-driven.

### What Can Users Do?

- **Create Custom Evaluation Criteria:** Any registered user or organization with access can now define their own set of criteria for evaluating companies within a specific industry or industry group.
- **Tailored Analysis:** This means users are no longer limited to the standard evaluation models. They can customize the analysis based on their own understanding, strategy, or research focus.

- **Same Powerful Process:** Once the custom criteria are set, the platform continues with the same process—extracting data from SEC filings and generating reports—but the evaluation is now shaped by the user’s own standards.

By allowing users to control how companies are assessed, KoalaGains ensures that the insights generated are more relevant, targeted, and aligned with each user’s unique perspective or investment approach.

## Why KoalaGains is needed

There are many platforms like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and Stockanalysis which share quantitative data about public entities, but they don't provide qualitative analysis. Then there are also platforms like Motley Fool and Seeking Alpha that provide opinions, but these sites lack industry-specific qualitative and quantitative information that would help investors identify the company's financial health and business in detail. This is where KoalaGains comes in, providing both qualitative and quantitative information about companies to investors using its features discussed below:

- KoalaGains provides industry-specific information about a company by allowing users to define the evaluation criteria for a specific industry group.
- KoalaGains, based on this criteria, extracts the required information from the company's latest SEC filings.
- KoalaGains can then create different reports based on the criteria defined.
- KoalaGains allows for the creation of more than one report under each criterion.
- The reports can be text-based or even visual, like Pie Charts, Spider Charts, Waterfall charts, Sankey Diagrams, etc.
- Some of the other features offered by KoalaGains are:
  - Performance Checklist
  - Important Metrics
  - Spider Chart

## Support Custom Reports

KoalaGains allows you to have an in-depth qualitative and quantitative analysis of a company's financial health and business. But along with this, our platform also allows anyone or any organization who registers here to create their own criteria for evaluating any industry or specific industry group. The details are as follows:

- Initially, the criteria for the industry group were defined by the KoalaGains Admins only, but later, any organization or person registered with KoalaGains with access will be able to create their own criteria for a specific industry group.
- They can define the criteria as per their own understanding, and the rest of the process will remain the same, with the difference being that the criteria based on which the company is being evaluated will now be under the control of the creator.

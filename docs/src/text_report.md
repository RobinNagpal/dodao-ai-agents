# Text Report

**Text Reports** are a valuable part of the reporting system on KoalaGains. While charts and checklists provide a high-level overview of a company's performance, **text reports deliver detailed explanations** that help investors understand the **"why" behind the numbers**.

These reports offer deeper context, combining data, analysis, and written interpretation—making them especially useful for investors who want a more complete understanding of a company’s position.

## Key Characteristics of Text Reports

- They provide **comprehensive insights** into the topic being evaluated, going beyond surface-level information.
- These reports include both **narrative explanations** and **supporting numerical data**, helping investors connect the story with the facts.
- Instead of offering vague or general statements, text reports are built on **factual observations and specific figures** pulled from trusted sources like SEC filings.
- In some cases, text reports also provide background or elaboration for **chart-based reports**, helping users understand the visualizations more clearly.

By combining written context with real data, KoalaGains' text reports give investors a deeper and more reliable view of a company's strengths, risks, and overall business health.

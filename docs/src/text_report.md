# Text Report

The Text Reports are also very important as they can provide the in detail information about the things instead of just showing the overall picture like done
by the charts and checklist reports which just show the overall picture of the project but without any expalantion or detail about that. So this detail is given by the text reports at KoalaGains. The characteristics of the text reports are:

- They provide the complete and comprehensive detail about the topic being discussed in report
- The numerical information is also provided with the information along
- These reports not just have the general statements but rather they have facts and figures along
- Some Text Reports may also be providing details about some of the chart reports

# Vision

Making investment decisions requires good amount of information which is presented in a way that is easy to understand,
but is also specific to investment category/industry/sub-industry.

The specific information is not available in the market right now. Creating such information using conventional methods
used to be very expensive, but with the advent of AI, it is now possible to create such information at a fraction of the cost.

AI helps us to move at least 20x faster. The product we have built/building was not possible without AI. We can now
compete with the best known investment related information websites.

We are building a platform that will provide raw data, quantitative and qualitative information on each of the
factor that can affect the performance and valuation of a company. The platform will also keep track of
current events, and trends in the industry. Along with this the platform will keep track of sentiment analysis
of various topics, keywords, products, sectors, and companies.

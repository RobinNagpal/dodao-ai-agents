# Using LangFlow

KoalaGains uses **LangFlow** to build the AI-powered flows that generate company reports. LangFlow is a visual tool that lets you create and connect components to process data and generate outputs using AI.

## Understanding the Interface

- On the **left panel (1)**, you‚Äôll find a list of available **components**. These components include tools for processing data, calling APIs, formatting outputs, and more.
- On the **right side (2)** is the **canvas**, where you can **drag and drop** components to design your workflow.

LangFlow allows you to visually connect and configure the logic behind how reports are generated‚Äîmaking it easier to create customized, AI-driven outputs without writing complex code.

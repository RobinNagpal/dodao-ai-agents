# Sectors and Industry Groups – Evaluation Criteria

To keep the evaluation process both effective and practical, KoalaGains focuses on analyzing companies at the **industry group level**. This approach allows us to strike the right balance—keeping the criteria specific enough to be meaningful, but broad enough to manage efficiently.

Each industry group has its own characteristics, challenges, and performance indicators. As a result, the evaluation criteria must be tailored to reflect those differences. For example, the metrics used to evaluate companies in the **Automobile & Components** group are very different from those used for companies in **Consumer Services**.

To support these unique needs, KoalaGains allows users to **define their own evaluation criteria** based on the specific industry group they are analyzing. This flexibility ensures that the analysis remains relevant and accurate for each type of company.

The **Spider Chart**—also known as a **Radar Chart**—is one of the key visual reports available on the KoalaGains platform. It helps investors quickly understand a company’s performance across multiple evaluation criteria in a single, easy-to-read graphic.

## How the Spider Chart Helps Investors

- The chart provides a **complete visual overview** of a company's performance.
- Each axis of the chart represents an evaluation criterion, with a **score out of 5** displayed on the graph.
- These scores are calculated based on the [**Performance Checklist**](./performance_cheklist_report.md), another report type used by KoalaGains.
- With just a glance, investors can understand **what the company offers** and how it performs relative to its key metrics.
- The Spider Chart also makes it easy to **compare two or more companies** within the same sector or industry group.

## What the Chart Shows

- The **area covered** by the chart reflects the company's overall standing. A larger, more balanced shape indicates stronger and more consistent performance.
- The **color** of the chart (e.g., green, orange, yellow) gives a visual cue about the company’s health—ranging from strong to weak in various areas.

This visual report is especially useful for investors who want to make quick comparisons and spot high-performing companies within a specific industry.

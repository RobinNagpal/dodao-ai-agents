# Spider Chart and Performance Checklist

Each company report on KoalaGains includes a **spider chart** that visually summarizes how the company performs across all selected evaluation criteria. This chart provides a quick and comprehensive overview, making it easier to identify strengths and weaknesses at a glance.

## Performance Checklist

For each evaluation criterion, a **performance checklist** is used to assess key areas. This checklist includes **five important indicators**, each scored individually:

- If the company meets the standard for an indicator, it receives **1 out of 1**.
- If it does not meet the standard, it receives **0 out of 1**.

The scores from all five indicators are then added together to give a **final score out of 5** for that criterion.

This simple scoring method allows for clear, consistent evaluations and makes it easy to compare performance across different companies and industry groups.

# Spider Chart, Performance Checklist

The report includes a spider chart that summarizes all the criteria and their ratings. Each criterion has a performance checklist consisting of five key indicators , with each indicator scored as either 1 out of 1 or 0 out of 1. The total score for the criterion is then calculated by summing these five indicatorâ€™s scores, resulting in a final rating out of 5.

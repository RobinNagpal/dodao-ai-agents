# Evaluating Public Equities

Evaluating public equities is one of the core features of KoalaGains. This process helps investors gain a deeper understanding of a company’s financial position, strengths, and potential risks by analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data.

At KoalaGains, we follow a structured approach to evaluating companies. Instead of relying only on surface-level financial figures, we focus on **industry-specific evaluation criteria** that allow for more accurate and meaningful assessments.

In this section, you’ll learn how we evaluate companies using a combination of custom criteria, industry classifications like GICS, and powerful visual tools. Each part of the process—from defining evaluation standards to generating reports—is explained step-by-step.

By the end of this section, you’ll know exactly how KoalaGains performs its analysis, and how you can use the platform to generate your own insights with clarity and confidence.

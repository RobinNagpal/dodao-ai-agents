# Creating and Seeing Reports

KoalaGains uses AI-powered workflows to generate insightful reports based on specific evaluation criteria. These reports can be either text-based or visual (such as pie charts or spider charts) and are designed to help investors understand a company's performance in a clear and structured way.

## Creating Reports

### How Are Reports Generated?

To generate a report, the KoalaGains platform sends specific informationâ€”including the companyâ€™s ticker and evaluation criteriaâ€”to an **AI Agent**. These AI Agents are built using **LangFlow**, a tool for designing and deploying AI workflows.

Here's how the process works:

- A **payload** containing the following information is prepared:

  - `ticker`: the stock symbol of the company.
  - `reportKey`: identifies which type of report to generate.
  - `criterion`: includes the key, name, a short description, important metrics, and report types.

- This payload is sent to the AI Agent via its unique URL.
- The AI Agent processes the information and returns a generated report.
- The generated report is then displayed on the KoalaGains platform.

### How Do the AI Agents Work?

The AI Agents created using LangFlow can be accessed via a direct URL. Each time a report is needed, the system sends the prepared JSON payload to the agent.

**Inside the agentâ€™s process:**

- The JSON data is converted into a message format that LangFlow components can understand.
- The value of the `reportKey` determines which part of the agent's flow will be triggered.

### Use of SEC 10-Q Data

In some cases, the agent also uses a tool to extract data from **SEC 10-Q filings**, including:

- Complete financial statements.
- Specific data related to the evaluation criteria, based on the `criterion.key` in the payload.

These two sets of data (financial statements and criteria-specific data) are then combined to provide a more complete report.

#### Role of the Report Key

The `reportKey` tells the system what kind of report to generate:

- If `reportKey` is **`all`**, the agent runs the full evaluation flow, which includes the performance checklist, important metrics, and all specific reports.
- If it is **`performanceChecklist`**, only the checklist is generated.
- If it is **`importantMetrics`**, only key metrics are included.
- If it refers to a specific report (e.g., **`debt_information`**), only that particular report is generated.

### Report Generation and Storage

Once the report is generated:

- It can be in text form or include visual elements like charts or graphs, depending on the `reportType` defined in the payload.
- The completed report is automatically **saved to an S3 bucket** (cloud storage) for future access.

## Viewing Reports

When viewing a company report, users can explore a **spider chart** that summarizes the company's performance across different criteria. Each criterion is scored based on its performance checklist, and detailed reports are available to explain the reasons behind each score.

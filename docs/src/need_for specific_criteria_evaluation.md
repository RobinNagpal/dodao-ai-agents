# Need for Specific Evaluation Criteria Based on Company Type

Every company belongs to a particular industry, and each industry comes with its own set of risks, challenges, and success factors. Because of these differences, evaluating all companies using the same criteria doesn’t give a complete or fair picture.

For example:

- **Manufacturing companies** are often judged based on their supply chain efficiency, production costs, and inventory management.
- **Financial institutions** are evaluated by looking at their capital strength, risk exposure, and liquidity.
- **Real estate firms** are assessed based on property location, occupancy rates, lease structures, and rental income.

As these examples show, the factors that matter most can vary greatly between industries. That’s why using a one-size-fits-all approach to analyze companies can lead to inaccurate conclusions.

Instead, KoalaGains uses **tailored evaluation criteria**—adjusted for each industry group—to ensure a more accurate, relevant, and meaningful analysis of a company’s performance and financial health.

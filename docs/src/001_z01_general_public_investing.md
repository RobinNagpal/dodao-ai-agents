## Use Case 1 - General Investing in Pubic Equities

Missing information in the market:

## Qualitative and qualitative information
All of this information exists in SEC fillings, but is not presented, because it was historically a bit expensive
to extract, and there might not be that big of an audience for it, because basic investors want simple information
and institutional investors want very detailed and accurate information.

This audience is underserved, and with AI we can serve them at a very low cost

### Sector specific information
When diversifying you would want to invest into top ~1-3 players in each sector, but now how do you find top 2-3
players in each sector.

### Undervalued companies
There is no easy way for a public investor to find this information

### Information on small/medium cap companies
There is not much information available for $100mm < mid-cap < $1B companies. Pulling this information can help
provide qualitative information

Note: All this information can be also embedded in investing platforms like I have a trading account with RBC, but the
information it provides is quite basic, and not much qualitative
